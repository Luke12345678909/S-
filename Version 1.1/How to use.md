# S# Version 1.1 tutorial
First we have to create a system. 
This is how we create a system: 
var system=new System(100,100);
Then we have to start it:
This is how I start it:
system.start();
Now I draw a bunch of points like this: 
system.point(x location of point,y location of point,color of point using color(RED,GREEN,BLUE));
I can also draw a background:
system.background(color using color(RED,GREEN,BLUE));
Then I type this:
system.updateScreen();
